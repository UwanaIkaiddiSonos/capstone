# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
# Character.create([
#   {
#     first_name: "Yuki",
#     last_name: "Sohma",
#     color: '#ffffff'
#   }
# ])
